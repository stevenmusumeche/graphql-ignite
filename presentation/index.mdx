# Build Better APIs

# Roy Fielding & REST

<Notes>
Nearly 20 years ago, Roy Fielding authored a landmark paper about how to structure hypermedia systems called REST.  A RESTful web app exposes information about itself in the form of resources.  Clients can take actions on those resources.

# The RESTful honeymoon period

<Pre>
GET    /v1/example.com/products    - Get all products<br />
GET    /v1/example.com/products/42 - Get product 42<br />
POST   /v1/example.com/products    - Create a new product<br />
DELETE /v1/example.com/products/42 - Delete product 42<br />
</Pre>

<Notes>
  We start off with an API that more or less follows RESTful conventions.  We can operate on the product resource by using the HTTP methods shown here.  Other resources folllow the same predictable convention.
</Notes>

# The product evolves

<Pre>
// all existing existing endpoints plus:<br /><br />

GET    /v1/example.com/products?detailed=true<br />
GET    /v1/example.com/products/42?fields=id,name,image<br />
GET    /v1/example.com/products/42?brand=sonos<br />
GET    /v1/example.com/products/42?with=categories<br />
</Pre>

<Notes>
  As our product evolves to support the business, we have new client needs, so we need to provide different versions of the same resource depending on the client.. A common example is supporting mobile apps that need smaller payloads.
</Notes>

# "Thousand endpoint problem"

<Pre>
// all existing existing endpoints plus new v2 versions:<br /><br />

GET    /v2/example.com/products    - Get all products<br />
GET    /v2/example.com/products/42 - Get product 42<br />
GET    /v2/example.com/products?detailed=true<br />
GET    /v2/example.com/products/42?fields=id,name,image<br />
GET    /v2/example.com/products/42?brand=sonos<br />
GET    /v2/example.com/products/42?with=categories<br />
</Pre>

<Notes>
  And then some more time goes by and you realize that you need to fundamentally rework the data that you return, and that’s a breaking change, so you redo the endpoints and bump the version number.

<Notes>
  But unfortunately, you can’t throw away your old API endpoints, because there are old clients that still rely on them.  You usually cannot force them to upgrade either. You’re stuck supporting (and testing, and upgrading) old endpoints forever.

<Notes>
  On the other hand, your product people, mobile devs, and frontend devs are all harassing you to add new stuff all the time, because they have problems that only you can solve.

# Too many requests

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tId4Qn6.png" style={{marginTop: 50}} />

<Notes>
  The first problem is that clients have to make a bunch of network calls to get the data required to display a single view or page.  This is very inefficient, especially for mobile devices on networks with high latency.
</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

# Overfetching

```javascript
{
    "id": "5c3567b062ce82e1d9ee1c64",
    "isActive": true,
    "balance": "$1,336.36",
    "picture": "http://placehold.it/32x32",
    "age": 26,
    "eyeColor": "green",
    "nameFirst": "Lynette",
    "nameLast": "Gallegos",
    "email": "lynette.gallegos@urbanshee.com",
    "phone": "+1 (905) 561-3636",
    "about": "Lorem mollit exercitation ad velit......",
  },
```

<Notes>
  REST endpoints typically return the entire resource.  But what if you only need a few fields, like name and email?  This is another problem that wastes bandwidth, especially on mobile devices.

# Missing or incorrect documentation

<img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/packaging-fail-funny-you-had-one-job-19__605.jpg" style={{marginTop: 50}} />

<Notes>
Finally, API documentation often doesn’t exist.  When it does exist, it’s often out of date. Correctness of documentation is not enforced because it isn’t generated from the actual source.

## a strongly-typed declarative query language

<Notes>
  GraphQL is a Facebook project that was released in 2015. It’s a fundamentally new way to do APIs. It’s a specification and language independent.  It's not at all tied to Javascript.
</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

<div style={{color:'white'}}>
A <u>STRONGLY-TYPED</u> DECLARATIVE QUERY LANGUAGES
</div>
<br />

# Strongly-typed

```javascript
type RootQueryType {
  currentUser: User
}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String!
  friends: [Friends!]!
}
```

<Notes>
  The strongly-typed part means that it is type safe. The inputs and outputs are defined in the GraphQL schema. Clients and servers from any language know what types of things are allowed in, and what kinds of data to expect in response.
</Notes>

<div style={{color:'white'}}>
A STRONGLY-TYPED <u>DECLARATIVE QUERY LANGUAGES</u>
</div>

<br />

# Declarative query language

```javascript
query { 
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  Declarative query language means that that you ask the server for the data that you want in the shape that you want it.  This is an example query. It kind of looks like JSON with the values removed.  It requests three fields for user 123.

<Introspection>Introspective</Introspection>

<Notes>
  We can ask a GraphQL server for information about what queries it supports via the introspection system.  This is used to automatically generate documentation and build query GUIs with autocompletion and other niceties.
</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

# Return matches query shape

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Steven Musumeche",
      "email": "steven@musumeche.com"
    }
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  The response from the server gives you proper JSON in the shape that you asked for, matching the pre-defined schema that the server supports.  This is a huge productivity boost for a number of reasons.

    Can you add this option to get the data back without this field and with that extra field for that new view I'm making?
  </Quote>
  <Cite>every UI developer ever</Cite>
</BlockQuote>

<Notes>
  You’re freeing up your UI developers to Get Shit Done. They don’t need you to write new endpoints every time they need slightly different data. They can compose the data they need in a single query and even get multiple resources in a single request.
</Notes>

---

# Mobile device latency and low-memory

<Notes>
  A RESTful API is like a fully normalized database, and clients end up needing to stitch data together from multiple requests to get the data for a given view. Each of those queries uses the network, CPU and memory, which can be very bad for performance.
</Notes>

---

# Single endpoint

<Notes>
  In GraphQL, there’s only one endpoint. By convention it is /graphql but it can be anything. You make GET requests for queries, and  POST requests for mutations.
</Notes>

---
export default CodeSlide

# Mutations

```
mutation {
  addComment(postId: "123", body: "my comment..") {
    commentId
    permalink
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  Mutations look like this, and you can define parameters of specific types, including whether or not those parameters are required and what the return value should be.
</Notes>

# Type nesting

```
query { 
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    friends { // <-- could come from an API
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  Type nesting allows joins across data stores - not just between database tables.  Clients can make a single request, and the server resolvers can retrieve data from different databases or even other APIs.  
</Notes>

---

# resolvers

<Notes>
  So how do servers work? The resolvers are where the magic happens. They are simply functions, and you can do whatever you want in there. Talk to your database, talk to another API, or do both at once.
